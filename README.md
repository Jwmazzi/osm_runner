## OSM Runner

A simple ORM that leverages the SpatialDataFrames of the ArcGIS API for Python
to integrate OSM data with the ArcGIS platform. This script was initially
developed for the [State of the Data](https://github.com/ngageoint/state-of-the-data)
project at NGA.

The functionality of OSM Runner can be better understood by setting up the osm_runner.ipynb
found in the sample notebooks found in the [Esri ArcGIS API for Python](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-python-api/tree/master/samples/02_power_users_developers) repository.
